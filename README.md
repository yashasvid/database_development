# oingo
database project

Oingo is a cross between Twitter and FourSquare. It is a system of textual notes that are visible at a certain location for a certain time range. Every user can create these notes for a certain audience (class) like friends, everyone, or self. These notes can be advertisements, reminders for future or notification notes for friends nearby etc. Every note is associated with certain tags that convey the essence of the note like #shopping, #me or #mustvisit.

The audience gets to decide which notes will they see by uploading filters on location, time, state, class and tags. A single user can upload several filters like the following : 
1.	Show me notes with tag #fitness from anyone when I am at New York Gym, everyday from 6am to 7am. 
2.	Show me notes with tag #food from friends when my state is ‘lunch break’
3.	Show me a reminder note of visiting hospital for a check-up on 28th December, 2018.

We have created a relational schema that can manage such a system.
